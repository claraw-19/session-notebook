## Git Repositories

A Git repository is a place where a project is being saved. It keeps track of all versions of the
project files. Many people can have access to (and work on) the same repository.

## Commits

A commit is a **snapshot of your repository** at a specific point in time. Creating a commit in your
project is similar to hitting the **save** button in a video game.
